This is the classic tic-tac-toe game build in ruby for the terminal, as a part of the lesson on Object Oriented Programming, of the Microverse curriculum.

### To play:
* Open your terminal
* Type "git clone https://github.com/serdg0/tic-tac-toe" and press ENTER.
* Type "cd tic-tac-toe" and press ENTER
* Type "ruby main.rb"
* ENJOY!

### The game: 
The game is based on a number-filled grid. Each number represent a cell. For putting your symbol in the desired cell, just type the number that correspond to it. Also, the player that first puts his/her name will always go first, being his symbol "X".

### HAVE FUN!
